description: Forge Core protocol plus Claude Code and Codex/manual drivers for KPI-driven autoregressive codebase improvement. Tracks coverage/speed/quality with baselines, rotates strategies on stagnation, and uses fresh-context evaluation. Activates when user mentions "forge it", "forge loop", "quality loop", "kpi loop", "improvement loop".

# The Forge — Core Protocol Plus Claude Code and Codex Drivers

A structured, KPI-driven improvement protocol that tracks coverage/speed/quality with baselines and targets, evaluates with fresh-context audits, rotates strategies when stagnating, and records lessons across iterations.

Built on the Ralph Wiggum loop pattern (Geoff Huntley), informed by Karpathy's autoregressive philosophy and SICA's compounding iteration approach.

## Activation Triggers
- "forge it", "forge this", "forge loop"
- "quality loop", "kpi loop", "improvement loop"
- "codebase improvement loop"
- When user wants structured, KPI-driven autonomous improvement

## Driver model

Forge has two layers:

- **Forge Core** — portable protocol, state model, KPI semantics, strategies, and completion rules
- **Driver** — runtime-specific integration that launches the loop, persists state, and handles pause/continue mechanics

`v0.4.1` ships two first-class drivers:

- **Claude Code** — command, agent, and stop-hook integration are bundled here
- **Codex** — `forge-init`, `forge-continue`, and `forge-cancel` manage a manual loop with project-local state

Other environments can reuse Forge Core manually, but should not be described as
officially supported unless they ship a real driver.

## The Forge Protocol

### A. ORIENT — Read State

Read the Forge state file for this session. Driver defaults:

- Claude Code: `.claude/forge-state.SESSION.md`
- Codex: `.codex/forge/forge-state.SESSION.md`

- Parse baseline KPIs, targets, iteration history, current strategy
- Check `stagnation_count` — if >= 3, MUST rotate strategy
- Review lessons from previous iterations (avoid repeating failures)
- First iteration: no state yet, proceed to MEASURE

### B. MEASURE — Capture Current KPIs

Run your test suite with coverage enabled and parse output for:
- **coverage**: percentage from cover summary
- **speed_seconds**: total test time
- **tests**: total test count
- **failures**: failure count
- **warnings**: compiler warning count (optional, first run)

**Elixir**: `mix test --cover 2>&1`
**Python**: `pytest --cov --cov-report=term 2>&1`
**JavaScript**: `npm test -- --coverage 2>&1`
**Ruby**: `bundle exec rspec 2>&1` (with SimpleCov)
**Go**: `go test -cover ./... 2>&1`

First iteration: record as **baseline** in forge-state.
Subsequent: compute deltas from previous iteration AND from baseline.

### C. EVALUATE — Fresh-Context Reality Check

**When**: iteration 1 AND every 3rd iteration thereafter (1, 4, 7, 10...).

Spawn a fresh-context audit using an agent or persona available in your environment (for example a code reviewer, security auditor, or refactorer) with:
- ONLY the scope files/modules
- Prompt: "Audit [scope]. Report findings by severity (high/medium/low). No context about KPI targets or iteration state."
- NO forge state, NO iteration context, NO KPI targets — unbiased evaluation

Main agent reviews findings critically against its KPI targets.
Record findings count by severity in forge-state.

### D. DECIDE — Pick Strategy

#### The Simplicity Criterion

All else being equal, simpler is better. When evaluating whether to keep a change:

- Improvement + ugly complexity → probably discard
- Improvement from DELETING code → definitely keep
- No metric change + simpler code → keep (that's a simplification win)
- Marginal gain from complexity → reject

This prevents complexity ratchet. Code removal for equivalent performance is always a win.

#### Available Strategies

| Strategy | When to use | Typical impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `component-extraction` | DRY violations, repeated patterns | Coverage + quality |
| `refactor-for-testability` | Code hard to test (private, coupled) | Coverage |
| `coverage-push` | Clear coverage gaps, uncovered modules | Coverage |
| `speed-optimization` | async:false overuse, slow fixtures, redundant DB | Speed |
| `dead-code-removal` | Unused code flagged by reality-check | Quality + coverage |
| `quality-polish` | Naming, complexity, clarity issues | Quality |
| `design-system` | Duplicated UI patterns, status badges | Quality + coverage |
| `simplification` | Complex code that can be made simpler | Quality (+ coverage if tests improve) |

#### Selection Logic

1. Compute **normalized KPI gap** for each target:
   - coverage_gap = (target - current) / target
   - speed_gap = (current - target) / current  (inverted — lower is better)
   - quality_gap = high_findings / 5  (scale 0..1)

2. **Largest gap** gets priority in strategy selection:
   - coverage_gap largest → `coverage-push` or `refactor-for-testability`
   - speed_gap largest → `speed-optimization`
   - quality_gap largest → `component-extraction` or `dead-code-removal`

3. **High findings from reality-check** → immediate `component-extraction` or `refactor-for-testability`

4. **Stagnation** (stagnation_count >= 3):
   - Pick best historical delta strategy OR untried strategy
   - Log: "Strategy '{current}' stagnating, switching to '{new}'"
   - Reset stagnation_count

5. **Never repeat a strategy that yielded negative deltas** without changing approach

### E. EXECUTE — ONE Focused Change

Each iteration does ONE thing well:

- **Structural refactoring** → use an available refactoring agent, or do the focused change directly
- **Clarity/polish** → use an available simplification/review agent, or do the focused change directly
- **Coverage gaps** → write tests + refactor for testability
- **Speed optimization** → convert sync to async tests, consolidate fixtures, reduce DB hits
- **Dead code removal** → delete unused code flagged by evaluation
- **Design system** → extract shared components (badges, cards, indicators)
- **Simplification** → delete dead code, reduce abstractions, flatten indirection

Use fresh-context agents when they are available and helpful; otherwise keep the change focused and do it directly.

### F. VERIFY — Tests Must Be Green

Run tests — **must be green** before proceeding.
If red: debug and fix within this iteration. Do NOT proceed to RECORD with failures.
Re-measure with coverage to capture post-change KPIs.

### G. RECORD — Update Forge State (THE Autoregressive Step)

Update the Forge state file for the current driver. Driver defaults:

- Claude Code: `.claude/forge-state.SESSION.md`
- Codex: `.codex/forge/forge-state.SESSION.md`

1. **Append iteration entry** with:
   - Iteration number
   - KPIs before and after (with deltas)
   - Strategy used
   - Actions taken (brief)
   - Findings count (if evaluation ran)
   - Lesson learned

2. **Update strategy tracking**:
   - Add iteration to current strategy's history
   - Record coverage_delta and speed_delta for the strategy

3. **Stagnation detection**:
   - Coverage delta < 0.1% for 2 consecutive iterations → increment stagnation_count
   - Any improvement > 0.1% → reset stagnation_count to 0

4. **Git commit** if tests green AND any improvement:
   - Stage changed files (NOT forge-state, it's in .claude/)
   - Commit with: `forge(N): [strategy] — [brief description]`

5. **Clean revert** if tests red or KPIs regressed AND no commit:
   - Revert only the files changed in the current iteration
   - If you cannot identify that set safely, stop and leave unrelated local work untouched
   - Record what was attempted in the iteration log (even failed attempts inform future decisions)

6. **Ideas backlog** — if the iteration surfaced promising but deferred opportunities:
   - Add to the `ideas` list in forge-state frontmatter
   - On future iterations, review backlog for combination opportunities

### H. COMPLETE — All Targets Met?

Check ALL conditions simultaneously:
- coverage >= min_coverage target
- speed_seconds <= max_speed_seconds target
- failures == 0
- high_findings == 0 (from last evaluation)

If ALL met → output `RALPH_COMPLETE` on its own line
If not → exit normally (stop hook re-injects prompt for next iteration)

## Stagnation Protocol

```
if stagnation_count >= 3:
  1. Log: "Strategy '{current}' stagnating after {N} low-delta iterations"
  2. Rank strategies by historical effectiveness (coverage_delta / iterations)
  3. Pick: best historical strategy OR untried strategy
  4. Reset stagnation_count to 0
  5. Record lesson: "'{old}' exhausted after iterations [X,Y,Z], switching to '{new}'"
```

### Getting Unstuck

When stagnation triggers (or when you run out of ideas within a strategy):

1. **Re-read scope files** — fresh eyes find new angles
2. **Review the ideas backlog** — deferred opportunities may be ripe now
3. **Combine near-misses** — two changes that individually didn't help may compound
4. **Try the inverse** — if adding X didn't help, try removing it (or vice versa)
5. **Think harder** — don't stop and ask. Read related code, look for patterns, try more radical changes
6. **Simplification pass** — can you delete code and maintain the same KPIs? That's a win

## Forge State File Format

Driver defaults:

- Claude Code: `.claude/forge-state.SESSION.md`
- Codex: `.codex/forge/forge-state.SESSION.md`

```yaml
---
session_id: "MMDD-HHMM-XXXX"
scope: "description of scope"
baseline:
  coverage: 92.99
  speed_seconds: 81
  tests: 21563
  failures: 0
  measured_at: "2026-03-20T14:30:00Z"
targets:
  min_coverage: 95.0
  max_speed_seconds: 40
  quality: "moderate"
  max_iterations: 20
current_strategy: "coverage-push"
stagnation_count: 0
strategies_tried:
  - name: "coverage-push"
    iterations: [1, 2]
    coverage_delta: 0.8
    speed_delta: -5
lessons:
  - "async:true on LiveView tests saves ~3s per file"
ideas:
  - "consolidate 3 similar fixture helpers into one parameterized function"
  - "auth module has dead code paths from v1 migration"
---

## Iteration 1 — coverage-push
- Coverage: 92.99 -> 93.15 (+0.16%)
- Speed: 81s -> 79s (-2s)
- Tests: 21563 -> 21578 (+15)
- Actions: Added 15 tests for data_loaders.ex edge cases
- Reality-check: 2 high, 3 medium findings
- Lesson: "data_loaders has 7 identical try-rescue - extract, don't test each"
```

## Quality Levels

| Level | High findings | Medium findings |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| `strict` | 0 | 0 |
| `moderate` | 0 | <= 3 |
| `lax` | 0 | <= 5 |

## Critical Rules

1. **ONE change per iteration** — resist the urge to batch. Small steps compound.
2. **Never skip VERIFY** — red tests mean the iteration failed. Fix before RECORD.
3. **Never fabricate KPIs** — always parse from actual test runner output.
4. **Fresh-context evaluation** — use an available isolated reviewer/audit pass to avoid anchoring bias.
5. **Lessons accumulate** — read ALL previous lessons before DECIDE. Never repeat a documented failure.
6. **Commit on green** — every improvement gets persisted to git.
7. **State file is sacred** — it survives context compaction. Keep it accurate.
8. **Simpler is better** — code deletion at same KPIs is always a win. Don't add complexity for marginal gains.
9. **Clean revert on failure** — restore clean state before the next iteration. Never leave dirty files.
10. **Never stop to ask** — if stuck, think harder. Re-read code, review backlog, combine near-misses, try the inverse.

## Support posture

- Claude Code support is first-class in this repo
- Codex support is first-class as a manual driver in this repo
- Other runtimes may reuse the protocol, but should not be described as
  officially supported unless they ship a real driver
