# forge-loop

**Forge Core plus a first-class [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) driver for autoregressive codebase improvement.**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3.0-green.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

Forge is a protocol plus an adapter. The protocol defines KPI tracking, state, strategy rotation, evaluation cadence, and completion rules. The bundled adapter makes that protocol run inside Claude Code with commands, agents, and a stop hook.

```
You: /forge "API controllers" --coverage 90 --speed -30%

Forge: Measuring baseline... 85.2% coverage, 120s
       Strategy: coverage-push → 15 tests for edge cases
       85.8% (+0.6%), 118s (-2s) ✓
       ...iterates until all targets met simultaneously...
```

## Core vs Driver

### Forge Core

The portable part of the system:

- iteration protocol (Orient → Measure → Evaluate → Decide → Execute → Verify → Record → Complete)
- state format and autoregressive memory
- KPI targets (coverage, speed, quality)
- strategy selection and stagnation handling
- lessons and ideas backlog

### Claude Code Driver

The bundled runtime adapter in this repo:

- `/forge` command
- `/cancel-ralph` command
- `agents/forge.md`
- `hooks/stop-hook.sh`
- install script that wires those assets into `~/.claude/`

This is the only first-class driver shipped in `v0.3.0`.

## Support Matrix

| Environment | Status | What is actually shipped |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | First-class | Command, agent, stop-hook driver, installer |
| Codex CLI | Protocol-only | Use Forge Core manually; no native loop driver shipped |
| Other agents / plain shell | Protocol-only | Reuse the protocol and state model manually |

Forge is not claiming native parity across agent runtimes. `v0.3.0` draws that line explicitly.

---

## Standing on the shoulders of

- **Ralph Wiggum** — [Geoff Huntley's](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) foundational work on autonomous AI development loops. Fresh context per iteration, files as message bus, backpressure as the quality mechanism. "Deterministically bad in an undeterministic world, but eventually consistent." Forge is our implementation of the Ralph loop pattern with structured KPI tracking and strategy rotation.
- **Andrej Karpathy** — [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch): 700 experiments in 2 days, ~20 additive improvements, 11% efficiency gain. The simplicity criterion ("code deletion for equivalent performance is always a win"), binary keep/discard with git reset, `program.md` as a "super lightweight skill", and "NEVER STOP" philosophy shaped forge's core design.
- **Tobi Lutke & David Cortes** — [pi-autoresearch](https://github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch): generalized the autoresearch pattern beyond ML to any software optimization. Noise estimation via MAD-based confidence scoring, backpressure checks (correctness gates separate from metric timing), persistent state via JSONL, and the ideas backlog pattern. Lutke's [context engineering](https://x.com/tobi/status/1909251946235437514) philosophy — "the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM" — is what makes loops work. 120 experiments on Shopify's Liquid yielded 53% faster parse+render.
- **SICA** (Self-Improving Coding Agent, [arxiv.org/abs/2504.15228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15228)) — Demonstrated that compounding iterations (17% to 53% SWE-Bench) work when the agent selects the best strategy from an archive of accumulated evidence.
- **autoresearch-mlx** — [trevin-creator](https://github.com/trevin-creator/autoresearch-mlx): not just a port but genuine architectural innovation. The agent autonomously discovered that depth=4 beats depth=8 under time-budget constraints. Nobody improved the loop itself across 4 forks — the largest untapped opportunity that forge addresses.

## How it works

### The Iteration Cycle

Each iteration executes one complete eight-phase cycle:

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **A. Orient** | Read forge-state file, check position + trends + stagnation count |
| **B. Measure** | Run tests with coverage, capture KPIs |
| **C. Evaluate** | Every 3rd iteration: spawn fresh-context subagent for unbiased audit |
| **D. Decide** | Pick strategy from KPI gaps + findings + lessons |
| **E. Execute** | Apply ONE focused transformation |
| **F. Verify** | Tests must be green, re-measure KPIs |
| **G. Record** | Update forge-state with deltas + lessons (the autoregressive step) |
| **H. Complete** | All targets met simultaneously? Done. Otherwise, next iteration. |

### Strategies

Forge selects from named strategies based on which KPI gap is largest:

| Strategy | When | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| `coverage-push` | Clear coverage gaps | Coverage |
| `refactor-for-testability` | Code hard to test | Coverage |
| `component-extraction` | DRY violations, repeated patterns | Coverage + Quality |
| `speed-optimization` | Slow tests, sync overuse | Speed |
| `dead-code-removal` | Unused code flagged by evaluation | Quality + Coverage |
| `quality-polish` | Naming, complexity, clarity | Quality |
| `design-system` | Duplicated UI patterns | Quality + Coverage |
| `simplification` | Code that can be made simpler | Quality |

### Stagnation Detection

When coverage improves by less than 0.1% for two consecutive iterations, forge increments a stagnation counter. Once the counter reaches 3, forge automatically rotates to a different strategy — the historically most effective one, or an untried one. No manual intervention needed.

### Fresh-Context Evaluation

Every 3rd iteration, Forge runs a fresh-context audit pass. In Claude Code this is typically a subagent; in other environments it may be an isolated reviewer or manual second pass. The protocol requires fresh context, not a specific vendor primitive.

---

## Installation

### Claude Code Driver

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DjinnFoundry/forge-loop.git
cd forge-loop
./install.sh
```

The installer symlinks the Claude Code driver assets into your `~/.claude/` directory.

**Important**: You also need to configure the stop hook that drives iteration. See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for setup instructions. If you already have the Ralph Wiggum stop hook configured, forge works with it automatically.

### Manual installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/forge ~/.claude/commands ~/.claude/agents

cp skills/forge/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/forge/SKILL.md
cp commands/forge.md ~/.claude/commands/forge.md
cp commands/cancel-ralph.md ~/.claude/commands/cancel-ralph.md
cp agents/forge.md ~/.claude/agents/forge.md

# Stop hook — see hooks/README.md for settings.json setup
```

### Codex / Manual Use

No native Codex loop driver ships in `v0.3.0`.

If you want to use Forge outside Claude Code:

1. Read [skills/forge/SKILL.md](skills/forge/SKILL.md) as the protocol source of truth.
2. Run one iteration at a time manually in your agent/runtime.
3. Persist state in the documented forge-state format.
4. Re-enter the next iteration using your runtime's own control surface.

That is protocol reuse, not first-class runtime support.

## Usage

### Claude Code

#### Basic

```
/forge "LiveView components" --coverage 95 --speed -20%
```

#### All options

```
/forge "SCOPE" --coverage N --speed -N% --quality strict|moderate|lax --max-iterations N
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `SCOPE` | (required) | What to improve — quoted string |
| `--coverage N` | baseline + 2 | Minimum coverage % target |
| `--speed -N%` | -20% | Speed reduction from baseline |
| `--quality` | moderate | strict (0 high, 0 med) / moderate (0 high, ≤3 med) / lax (0 high, ≤5 med) |
| `--max-iterations` | 20 | Safety limit |

#### Control

- **Pause**: Forge outputs `RALPH_PAUSE` when it needs your input
- **Cancel**: `/cancel-ralph` stops the loop
- **Inspect state**: `.claude/forge-state.SESSION.md` is preserved when you pause or cancel

### Protocol-Only / Manual

Use the same protocol phases and state format, but drive the loop yourself. Today that means:

- no bundled Codex command
- no bundled Codex stop hook
- no runtime-specific install story outside Claude Code

---

## State File

Forge persists its state in `.claude/forge-state.SESSION.md` in the Claude Code driver. Other runtimes can reuse the same format in a different state root. Each iteration appends its KPIs, strategy, actions, and lessons. This is the autoregressive memory.

```yaml
---
session_id: "0320-1430-a3b2"
scope: "API controllers"
baseline:
  coverage: 85.2
  speed_seconds: 120
  tests: 1250
  failures: 0
  measured_at: "2026-03-20T14:30:00Z"
targets:
  min_coverage: 90.0
  max_speed_seconds: 84
  quality: "moderate"
  max_iterations: 20
current_strategy: "component-extraction"
stagnation_count: 0
strategies_tried:
  - name: "coverage-push"
    iterations: [1, 2]
    coverage_delta: 0.8
    speed_delta: -5
lessons:
  - "async:true on controller tests saves ~3s per file"
ideas:
  - "auth module has dead code paths worth investigating"
---

## Iteration 1 — coverage-push
- Coverage: 85.2 → 85.8 (+0.6%)
- Speed: 120s → 118s (-2s)
- Tests: 1250 → 1265 (+15)
- Actions: Added 15 tests for data_loaders edge cases
- Reality-check: 2 high, 3 medium findings
- Lesson: "7 identical try-rescue blocks — extract, don't test each"
```

```

The current runtime layout is intentionally asymmetric: the protocol is portable, but the bundled automation is Claude-specific. The Claude driver uses the Ralph loop pattern: each time the Claude Code session tries to exit, the stop hook re-injects the forge prompt. The forge state file provides continuity across iterations and context compactions.

---

## Design Principles

Distilled from studying autoresearch, Ralph Wiggum, pi-autoresearch, SICA, and a dozen forks:

1. **Loops are simple. The magic is in the loop.** The universal pattern is: Modify, Measure, Compare, Keep/Discard, Record, Repeat. Everything else is details.
2. **Simpler is better.** Code deletion at same KPIs is always a win. Don't add complexity for marginal gains.
3. **Autonomy scales when you constrain scope, clarify success, and mechanize verification.** Tests aren't just QA — they're the rails the loop runs on.
4. **Binary keep/discard.** Improved? Keep. Didn't? Revert. No gray area, no partial credit.
5. **State survives context.** The forge-state file is the autoregressive memory. It survives context compaction, agent restarts, and session swaps.
6. **Fresh eyes beat anchored ones.** Subagents with no iteration context prevent "the numbers look fine" bias.
7. **Think harder, don't stop.** When stuck: re-read code, review backlog, combine near-misses, try the inverse, try simplification. Never pause to ask.
8. **Each improvement should make future improvements easier.** (Addy Osmani)

## Why not just raw loops?

| Aspect | Raw loop | Forge |
|--------|----------|-------|
| KPI tracking | Ad-hoc | Structured state file with deltas + trends |
| Strategy | Single prompt | 8 named strategies, auto-rotation on stagnation |
| Evaluation | Self-evaluation (anchoring bias) | Fresh-context audits every 3 iterations |
| Memory | Context window only | Persistent state file survives compaction |
| Completion | Manual / hope | Exact completion marker after protocol checks |
| Lessons | Lost between iterations | Accumulated, inform strategy selection |
| Stagnation | Repeats same approach | Detects + rotates after low-delta iterations |
| Portability | Rebuild per runtime | Portable protocol, Claude driver bundled |

---

## Claims We Are Willing To Make

- Forge packages proven loop patterns into a reusable protocol with a first-class Claude Code driver.
- Forge improves repeatability versus ad-hoc prompting when you care about KPI targets, iteration memory, and strategy rotation.
- Forge does **not** yet provide native Codex parity or a universal runtime adapter layer.
- Forge is more preconfigured than raw hooks. It is not a new primitive.

## Requirements

### Claude Code Driver

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- `jq` (for the stop hook)
- A project with a test suite that reports coverage

### Protocol-Only Reuse

- Any agent/runtime that can follow the Forge protocol manually
- Some place to persist Forge state between iterations
- A project with a measurable test/quality loop

## Adapting for other languages

The skill includes test runner examples for multiple languages (Elixir, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go). To adapt:

1. Edit `skills/forge/SKILL.md` — update the MEASURE phase for your test runner
2. Update the coverage/speed parsing for your output format
3. Everything else (strategies, stagnation, state format) is language-agnostic
